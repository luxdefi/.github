## Hi there 👋
🙋‍♀️ ▼ LUX is a decentralized network of blockchains that aims to make it easy for anyone to invest in real world assets (RWAs).
🌈 The community can get involved by participating in the development of the Lux Network, providing feedback and suggestions, and contributing to its open source projects.
👩‍💻 Resources for the community include the [Lux Finance](https://docs.lux.finance) and [Lux Network](https://docs.lux.network) docs where documentation and technical specifications can be found.
🍿 Fun fact: The Lux Finance team enjoys a variety of breakfast options and there is no specific team breakfast.
🧙 We welcome all wizards to communicate and collaborate on the development of the Lux network with us!

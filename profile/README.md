Lux is a decentralized network of blockchains that aims to make it easy for anyone to invest in real world assets (RWAs).

🌈 The community can get involved by participating in the development of the Lux Network, [providing feedback and suggestions](mailto:hi@lux.finance), and contributing to its [open source projects](https://github.com/luxdefi/).

👩‍💻 Resources for the community include the [Lux Finance](https://docs.lux.finance) and [Lux Network](https://docs.lux.network) docs where documentation and technical specifications can be found.

🍿 Fun fact: The Lux team enjoys a variety of breakfast options and there is no specific team breakfast.

🧙 We welcome all wizards to communicate and collaborate on the development of the Lux network with us!
